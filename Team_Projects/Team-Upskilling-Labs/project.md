## Challenge Category 3: Jobs and Youth

See [www.dc2.org/datadive](https://www.dc2.org/datadive) for details on this challenge area.

## Project Description

Team Upskilling Labs used AI to analyse and build visualizations exploring the future of education, jobs, and what youth skills will matter most in 2035.

### Background
Using UN population projections and World Bank educational attainment projections, we merged four core datasets (UN\_Pop\_Projections, UN\_Shr\_Projections, WD\_MYS, WD\_PRP) to model how **the size and skill composition of youth (ages 15–24)** will change between **2025 and 2035** under the *Medium/Scenario 2* pathway.

Our merged dataset captures for each country:

* Youth population by age group, sex, and scenario  
* Educational distribution (No Education → Master+)  
* Absolute numbers by region  
* Gender gaps  
* Growth trajectories  
* Global talent concentration  
* Outliers (leaders and risks)

This allowed us to answer the core Challenge 6 question:  
**Which youth skills will matter most in 2035, and where will they be concentrated?**

## **Key Findings**

### 1\. The world’s skill center of gravity shifts toward Asia

By 2035, **48% of all skilled youth** (post-secondary \+ tertiary) will live in **East Asia & Pacific (EAP)**.  
Adding **South Asia** raises Asia’s share to **\~65%** of global skilled talent.

**Implication:** Global jobs, especially digital/AI roles, will increasingly be supplied by Asia.

---

### 2\. Sub-Saharan Africa is the demographic engine—but not yet the skills engine

* Africa contributes the largest **growth** in youth population and in upper-secondary expansion.  
* However, it still holds the world’s highest numbers of **low-education** youth (No Education, Primary Only).  
* Skill growth is fast (post-secondary \+60%), but from a low base.

**Implication:** Africa’s challenge is not population, but *skills readiness* for the digital economy.

---

### 3\. Upper secondary is the dominant global education level of 2035

Across almost all regions, **Upper Secondary** is the largest and fastest-growing segment.  
This suggests that most of the world’s labor force will enter the market with *intermediate* skills.

**Implication:** Future job programs must build from mid-skills upward — especially digital literacy and applied problem-solving.

---

### 4\. Gender shifts reshape talent — women surpass men in many countries

Countries where **young women exceed young men in post-secondary education** include:  
**USA, Indonesia, Russia, Philippines, Japan, Brazil, Korea, Vietnam, France, Turkey.**

**Implication:** The future talent gap is increasingly male — not female — in higher education.

---

### 5\. Risk Alert: Some countries will see rising numbers of uneducated youth

Despite global progress, several countries show **increases** in youth with *no education*:  
**Nigeria, Algeria, Iraq, CAR, Zimbabwe, Mongolia, Congo, Vanuatu** and others.

**Implication:** These countries risk falling completely outside the future digital labor market.

---

### 6\. Country Leaders (2035)

* **Tertiary-Educated Youth:** China, USA, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia.  
* **Upper Secondary:** India, China, Pakistan, USA, Indonesia, Nigeria.  
* **Low Education (Risk):** Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Ethiopia, Afghanistan.

**Implication:** Future job platforms must target where the talent (and gaps) truly are.

---

### 7\. Global Talent Concentration Index (HHI \= 0.285)

This indicates **moderate concentration** — not fully diversified.  
Meaning: A small number of regions dominate skilled youth supply.

**Implication:** Companies and countries will compete for talent from a relatively narrow set of regions.

---

## Conclusion

**The most important skill level in 2035 is mid-to-high skilled youth — especially those with Upper Secondary and Post-Secondary education — concentrated overwhelmingly in Asia.**

Meanwhile, the world’s demographic boom in Africa will not convert into a skills boom without targeted intervention.

To prepare for 2035, policymakers must:

* Scale post-secondary vocational and digital programs  
* Address gender education shifts  
* Target high-growth populations in Asia and Africa  
* Support rescue policies for countries where low education is rising
