## **Youth Skills in 2035: Who Will Power the Future Workforce?**

**Challenge 6 — Exploring the Future of Education & Jobs**

### **Background**

Using UN population projections and World Bank educational attainment projections, we merged four core datasets (UN\_Pop\_Projections, UN\_Shr\_Projections, WD\_MYS, WD\_PRP) to model how **the size and skill composition of youth (ages 15–24)** will change between **2025 and 2035** under the *Medium/Scenario 2* pathway.

Our merged dataset captures for each country:

* Youth population by age group, sex, and scenario  
* Educational distribution (No Education → Master+)  
* Absolute numbers by region  
* Gender gaps  
* Growth trajectories  
* Global talent concentration  
* Outliers (leaders and risks)

This allowed us to answer the core Challenge 6 question:  
**Which youth skills will matter most in 2035, and where will they be concentrated?**

## **Key Findings**

### **1\. The world’s skill center of gravity shifts toward Asia**

By 2035, **48% of all skilled youth** (post-secondary \+ tertiary) will live in **East Asia & Pacific (EAP)**.  
Adding **South Asia** raises Asia’s share to **\~65%** of global skilled talent.

**Implication:** Global jobs, especially digital/AI roles, will increasingly be supplied by Asia.

---

### **2\. Sub-Saharan Africa is the demographic engine—but not yet the skills engine**

* Africa contributes the largest **growth** in youth population and in upper-secondary expansion.  
* However, it still holds the world’s highest numbers of **low-education** youth (No Education, Primary Only).  
* Skill growth is fast (post-secondary \+60%), but from a low base.

**Implication:** Africa’s challenge is not population, but *skills readiness* for the digital economy.

---

### **3\. Upper secondary is the dominant global education level of 2035**

Across almost all regions, **Upper Secondary** is the largest and fastest-growing segment.  
This suggests that most of the world’s labor force will enter the market with *intermediate* skills.

**Implication:** Future job programs must build from mid-skills upward — especially digital literacy and applied problem-solving.

---

### **4\. Gender shifts reshape talent — women surpass men in many countries**

Countries where **young women exceed young men in post-secondary education** include:  
**USA, Indonesia, Russia, Philippines, Japan, Brazil, Korea, Vietnam, France, Turkey.**

**Implication:** The future talent gap is increasingly male — not female — in higher education.

---

### **5\. Risk Alert: Some countries will see rising numbers of uneducated youth**

Despite global progress, several countries show **increases** in youth with *no education*:  
**Nigeria, Algeria, Iraq, CAR, Zimbabwe, Mongolia, Congo, Vanuatu** and others.

**Implication:** These countries risk falling completely outside the future digital labor market.

---

### **6\. Country Leaders (2035)**

* **Tertiary-Educated Youth:** China, USA, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, Brazil, Indonesia.  
* **Upper Secondary:** India, China, Pakistan, USA, Indonesia, Nigeria.  
* **Low Education (Risk):** Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Ethiopia, Afghanistan.

**Implication:** Future job platforms must target where the talent (and gaps) truly are.

---

### **7\. Global Talent Concentration Index (HHI \= 0.285)**

This indicates **moderate concentration** — not fully diversified.  
Meaning: A small number of regions dominate skilled youth supply.

**Implication:** Companies and countries will compete for talent from a relatively narrow set of regions.

---

## **Big Conclusion**

**The most important skill level in 2035 is mid-to-high skilled youth — especially those with Upper Secondary and Post-Secondary education — concentrated overwhelmingly in Asia.**

Meanwhile, the world’s demographic boom in Africa will not convert into a skills boom without targeted intervention.

To prepare for 2035, policymakers must:

* Scale post-secondary vocational and digital programs  
* Address gender education shifts  
* Target high-growth populations in Asia and Africa  
* Support rescue policies for countries where low education is rising

## **SLIDE 2 — The Problem**

* By 2035, global labor markets will be radically different.  
* Youth supply (15–24) shifts dramatically across regions.  
* Skills, not just population, will decide who benefits from digital/AI jobs.

**Key Question:**

*Which youth skills will matter most in 2035 — and where will they be located?*

# **✅ Short On-Stage Narrative (3–5 minutes)**

Here is the script you can practice:

---

“Good afternoon, everyone.

We explored Challenge 6: *What skills will matter most in 2035, and where will they be?*  
To answer this, we merged UN and World Bank projections across 185 countries, interpolating youth population, education shares, and absolute skill counts under Scenario 2\.

What emerges is a striking picture.

First, the world’s dominant skill level in 2035 will be **Upper Secondary**. It is the backbone of the global labor market. But what truly matters is *where* these skills are concentrated.

And the answer is clear: **Asia — not the West — becomes the world’s skills center.**  
East Asia alone holds **48% of all skilled youth**, and when you add South Asia, Asia’s share rises to **about 65%**. This means the future supply of digital, AI, and technical labor is fundamentally Asian.

Meanwhile, Sub-Saharan Africa becomes the world’s demographic engine — but not yet the skills engine. Africa shows the fastest growth in post-secondary education, but from the lowest base, and remains home to the largest population of youth with no education.

Gender shifts add another layer. By 2035, young women will outnumber young men in post-secondary education in countries like the US, Japan, Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines, and South Korea — suggesting a future male skills deficit in many advanced economies.

We also highlight risk countries. While most of the world continues to improve, several nations — including Nigeria, Algeria and Iraq — will actually see *increases* in the number of youth with no education. These are potential global hotspots for exclusion from future jobs.

What does this all mean?

Three things:

1. We must **scale post-secondary and digital skills**, especially in Africa and South Asia.  
2. We must **invest in gender-balanced talent pipelines**, because women are emerging as the majority in higher education.  
3. And globally, employers and policymakers must recognize that the *future of jobs is powered by Asian youth*, and the competition for this talent will intensify.

In short:  
**2035 will not just be a demographic turning point — but a skills turning point. The regions that invest in mid-to-high skill youth today will define tomorrow’s global economy.”**
