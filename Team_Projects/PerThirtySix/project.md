# PerThirtySix  ⭐ (Winning Project)

An interactive data visualization exploring the relationship between regulatory environments and economic outcomes using World Bank data.

## Overview

PerThirtySix analyzed the World Bank's Business Ready (B-READY) regulatory indicators alongside Worldwide Governance Indicators to explore how regulatory frameworks impact economic development. We built an interactive web-based tool that allows users to visualize relationships between governance metrics, regulatory performance, and various economic outcomes across 200+ countries.

## Project Description

PerThirtySix built an interactive data explorer combining:

1. **Data table** with inline visualizations for quick country comparisons
2. **D3.js visualizations** showing relationships between regulatory framework and public services
3. **Custom explorer** allowing users to compare any metric against any other metric, with the ability to color by region or income group

The tool integrates:
- **B-READY indicators**: 3 regulatory performance pillars (Framework, Services, Efficiency)
- **Worldwide Governance Indicators**: 6 dimensions (Government Effectiveness, Rule of Law, Voice & Accountability, Political Stability, Regulatory Quality, Control of Corruption)
- **Economic outcomes**: GDP, life expectancy, literacy rates, and other development indicators

All visualizations are client-side, real-time, and responsive, enabling users to quickly identify patterns, outliers, and relationships between regulatory environments and economic development outcomes.
